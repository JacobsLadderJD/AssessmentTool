## Project installation
These installation instructions are designed with UNIX-based systems in mind. Both Mac and Ubuntu will be covered here. Windows installation may vary, but links to external tutorials will be provided where appropriate.

### Installing Node.js
#### 1. Download Node.js
Navigate to the [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for Node.js and download the most recent LTS.
#### 2. Install Node.js
Once you have downloaded Node.js, run the file you have downloaded to begin the installation procedure by running the file.

Test your installation by running the following:
```shell
$ node --version
```
It should return something higher than v9.0.0.
#### 3. Clone the repository
Clone the code from this repository.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JacobsLadderJD/AssessmentTool.git
```
Now the "AssessmentTool" folder should appear in the directory where your cloned the project.
#### 4. Install the app dependencies
Enter the root directory of the project and install the required packages.
```shell
$ cd AssessmentTool
$ npm install
```
Now the application, along with its relevant libraries, should be installed locally.

#### 5. Run the app
The following commands are provided by default in the package.js file for this project.
```shell
# run in development mode
$ npm run serve

# compile and minify for production
$ npm run build

# lint and fix files
$ npm run lint
```
### Troubleshooting
Based on experience, a few things may cause problems when attempting to install or run the application. These issues are enumerated below.
#### I. The data in the pages isn't loading
###### Make sure the API is running
If data in the pages is not showing up, it may be because the API is not running locally. Please see the [AssessmentAPI documentation](https://github.com/JacobsLadderJD/AssessmentAPI) and ensure that you have it configured and running properly.
###### Make sure the database is populated
Through the Admin Panel, add at least one user, evaluator, evaluation, and student so that the application has data to show.

#### II. Vue <slot\> elements are not cooperating
If slots are not working in Vue.js, despite the Vue.js documentation, it is likely an issue with the new changes to slots in Vue.js v2.6. This project is built with Vue.js v2.5, so the syntax is different. See [this documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Deprecated-Syntax) for details.

#### III. The application won't run
###### Check the node.js version
If your node version is below v9.8 the application may not run properly. Download the [latest LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your system as instructed in the installation instructions.
###### Update the npm packages
If a developer has just added a new dependency to the project, you will need to install it before launching the application. To solve this problem, run the following command in the project's root directory:
```shell
$ npm install
```
Then the new dependencies will be updated (as long as they are listed in the package.json file).
